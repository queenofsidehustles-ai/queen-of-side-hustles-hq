# All-in-One Business App v5.0

**A complete business operating system that replaces GoHighLevel, Calendly, Mailchimp, and Shopify — built with Flask, designed for small businesses, and ready to resell as a done-for-you service.**

Built by [Simple Tech Skills](https://simpletechskills.com) for the Saturday Workshop.

---

## What Is This?

This is a single Flask application that gives any small business everything they need to run their operations from one login:

- **CRM** — contacts, deals pipeline, activity tracking
- **Content Automation** — AI-powered content creation with real-time pipeline visualization
- **Calendar Booking** — appointment scheduling with a public booking page
- **AI Assistant (Jackie)** — business advisor powered by OpenAI or OpenRouter
- **Email Marketing** — templates, automation, and send tracking via Resend
- **E-Commerce Store** — product catalog with Stripe checkout
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Umami-style visitor tracking and revenue charts
- **Website Pages** — landing pages, sales pages, and funnel management
- **Client Onboarding** — survey forms that auto-create CRM records

The goal: one app, one login, one subscription — replace $300+/month in SaaS tools.

---

## Who Is This For?

### Business Owners
Small business owners (gyms, salons, home services, professional services) who want to stop paying for GoHighLevel, Calendly, Mailchimp, and Shopify separately. Install this, customize it with Claude Code, and run your entire business from one dashboard.

### Resellers / Agency Owners
People who want to sell done-for-you business systems to local businesses. Use this as your template, customize it per client, and charge $2,000-$5,000 for setup + $97-$300/month for maintenance. The app includes a built-in sales playbook with pricing packages.
